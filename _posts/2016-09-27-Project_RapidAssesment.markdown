Project Objective
--------------

This project aims to develop tools for rapid assement of national documents (e.g. infrastructure development plans, laws,  development project documents) to reveal their alignment with the targets established by the sustainable development goals. [Clik to see the targets](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld).

Project deliverables
------------

This project will result on web applications to accelerate the delivery of country assements carried out by international agencies for development such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). For exaple, the Rapid Integrated Assement studies which are being carried out in more than 30 countries by UNDP within the next year, see for example:

[RAPID INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT â€“ BHUTAN SDG PROFILE](https://undg.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/RIA_Bhutan_Key_Observations-18.12.2015.pdf)

[Mauritania: Early efforts to mainstream SDGs within a new national development strategy](https://undg.org/main/undg_document/mauritania-demonstrating-early-efforts-to-mainstream-sdgs-within-a-new-nat/)

However, the desk review of the documentation is lenghty, taking away valuable time for analysis. Ideally, the tools developed through thsi project will make the national documents easy to search by develompent topic and to provide a machine-based initial assesment of the alignment with the SDG targets.

Project Team
------------

This team is advised by staff members from the United Nations Development Programme who provide background as well as detailed information about their current methods for rapid integrated assesments as well as their needs to expedite their work.
