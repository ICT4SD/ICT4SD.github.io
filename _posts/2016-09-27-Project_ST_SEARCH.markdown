Project Objective
------------
This project aims to use machine-based classification of text to build a searchable repository of papers, websites, training materials, and other useful knowledge for sustainable development. 

This search engine will include content from across the Internet originating from credible organizations from academia, governments and private companies.

Unlike the leading search engines in the market which seek to aggregate as much content as possible, this one aims to provide a machine-curated result set from reputable sources.


Useful resources
------------

- [Common Crawl](http://commoncrawl.org/), an open dataset of web crawl data that can be accessed and analyzed by anyone.
- [Common Search](https://about.commonsearch.org/), a nonprofit search engine for the Web.
- [Spyglass](https://github.com/o19s/spyglass), a simple search results front-end for Apache Solr using EmberJS.
