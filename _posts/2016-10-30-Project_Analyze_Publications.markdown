Project Objective
--------------

This project seeks solutions to analyze thousands of pages published by United Nations Agencies, Funds and Programmes to view which have been the most and least covered topics over time and to identify the key issues, challenges and recommendations mentioned by the thousands of researchers, consultants, government experts who have contributed to these publications for over 4 decades.

However, the United Nations publications are published in a variety of formats and languages and are not easy to analyze. Some examples of publications can be seen here:

[Publications by the Department of Economic and Social Affairs](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/publications/index.html)

[Publications by the United Nations University](http://unu.edu/publications)

[Publications by the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific](http://www.unescap.org/publications/)


Project deliverables
------------

This project will result on a web application enabling search and visualization of the body of documents given. The web application will allow the user to view a timeline of the topics discussed, the keywords used, the main entities (e.g. people, places, organizations, etc.) mentioned.

The tool will also add metadata to individual sentences in each publication to tag if a sentence refers to one or more Sustainable Development Goal and if they are a "policy recommendation", "barriers or challenges", of if they indicate "causality" (when a sentence mentions a cause - effect relation).


Deliverable A
---------------
A target deliverable of this project consists on doing the analysis for the publications of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs.


Deliverable B
---------------
Another deliverable consists on doing the analysis for publications relating to the issues of Small Island Developing States (SIDS). This deliverable will be useful for the preparations of the upcoming "Symposium on Implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SAMOA Pathway in Small Islands Developing States - SIDS" which will be held in February 2017 in Nassau.  

The list of SIDS can be found here:
