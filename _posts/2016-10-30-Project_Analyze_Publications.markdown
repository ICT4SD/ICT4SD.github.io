Project Objective
--------------

This project seeks solutions to analyze thousands of pages published by United Nations Agencies, Funds and Programmes to view which have been the most and least covered topics over time and to identify the key issues, challenges and recommendations mentioned by the thousands of researchers, consultants, government experts who have contributed to these publications for over 4 decades.

Project deliverables
------------

This project will result on a web application enabling search and visualization of the body of documents given. The web application will allow the user to view a timeline of the topics discussed, the keywords used, the main entities (e.g. people, places, organizations, etc.) mentioned.

The tool will also add metadata to individual sentences to tag them as "policy recommendations", "barriers or challenges", "causality" (when a sentence mentions a cause - effect relation). Sentences should also be tagged by the Sustainable Development Goal they refer to.
