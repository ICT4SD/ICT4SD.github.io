---
In 2015, more than 190 world leaders committed to 17 [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs) (SDG) to end extreme poverty, fight inequality, injustice, climate change, and other critical issues affecting humanity.

The United Nations Office of Information and Communications Technology promotes collaboration between Academia, private sector, civil society, and governments to use open data and build open source software for the implementation of the SDGs.

Are you from Academia?
----------------------

Faculty, graduate (masterâ€™s degree) and doctoral students are invited to join this programme individually or in teams.

Are you a data provider?
----------------------

If you have open data which you would like to make available and believe can be used to implement the SDGs, we would like to hear from you.

Do you want to start a new project?
----------------------

If you have an idea to use ICT to implement the SDGs and need help getting started, we would like to hear from you!
